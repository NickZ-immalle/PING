# Ping
Ping is my version and interpretation of the well known Pong game made by Allan Alcorn.
Ping is like Pong but at the same time something totally different ! 
The game includes obstacles, increasing speed, self-made pixel art backgrounds and a lot of fun !

# How to play ?
The game is really easy. The game starts by pressing your left mouse button. You can also pause the game if you click it again. You start off playing against the PC (= an AI if you will). It is impossible to win against the computer, but there is a scoreboard to give you hope. This is an early version of the game, in a later version you can choose to play vs a friend instead of the PC. This way the scoreboard isn't useless.

# How to install ?
You only have to make a folder. This folder should inculde the .pde files and the .png file. They have to be in the same folder because if they don't the program won't work. It isn't very hard, anyone should be able to do it.
